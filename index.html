       <p id="intro">One of the best and memorable trips that I've had was when I went on a trip with my friends to Goa. Goa is a state on the southwestern 
					coast of India and its capital is Panaji. The official language, which is spoken by a majority of its inhabitants, is Konkani. Goa is 
					visited by a large number of international and domestic tourists every year for its white sand beaches, active nightlife, places of worship 
					and World Heritage-listed architecture. It also has rich flora and fauna as it lies on the Western Ghats range.
		</p>
		<p id="intro">The idea of a trip came up one summer evening when we were all bored and didn't have anything to do. My group of friends and I were just 
						sitting in our backyard and looking out for places where we could possibly go for a holidy and we thought "Goa" the land of beaches 
						would be the perfect vacation spot for us to go. We were all excited, took permission from our parents and off we went on a four day 
						trip. We were travelling by train and you know you've reached when you see your train passing next to the famous Dudhsagar Falls. 
		<p>
		<p id="intro"> Below are the top 10 places that we visited along with a short description about the significance of the place and why it's famous.

					a Buddhist fashion but the idols of Nandi and the Shivaling outside the main entrance of the smaller of the two caves reveal another aspect.

					up to them you pass several small Goan villages on your way which are good and hospitable resting spots during the trek.
